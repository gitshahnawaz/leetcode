Hint
Given a 0-indexed string s, permute s to get a new string t such that:

All consonants remain in their original places. More formally, if there is an index i with 0 <= i < s.length such that s[i] is a consonant, then t[i] = s[i].
The vowels must be sorted in the nondecreasing order of their ASCII values. More formally, for pairs of indices i, j with 0 <= i < j < s.length such that s[i] and s[j] are vowels, then t[i] must not have a higher ASCII value than t[j].
Return the resulting string.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in lowercase or uppercase. Consonants comprise all letters that are not vowels.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "lEetcOde"
Output: "lEOtcede"
Explanation: 'E', 'O', and 'e' are the vowels in s; 'l', 't', 'c', and 'd' are all consonants. The vowels are sorted according to their ASCII values, and the consonants remain in the same places.
Example 2:

Input: s = "lYmpH"
Output: "lYmpH"
Explanation: There are no vowels in s (all characters in s are consonants), so we return "lYmpH".
